TITLE : " SECURE DATA HIDING IN IMAGES USING STEGANOGRAPHY "

Summary:

The project demonstrates a robust method of hiding data inside images using Python, OpenCV (cv2), NumPy, and OS libraries. 
The system allows for both embedding and extracting data with high accuracy.
While the method is simple, it provides a secure way to hide information, and future enhancements can improve encryption and multi-layer security.

Technologies Used :

Python: The primary language for building the system due to its simplicity and efficiency in working with image and data manipulation.
OpenCV (cv2): For image processing tasks such as loading, displaying, and saving the image. OpenCV helps to manage pixel-level manipulations.
NumPy: To handle image data efficiently, perform matrix operations, and manage pixel manipulation in the image.
OS: Used for file handling tasks, including reading/writing data to/from the system and managing image paths
